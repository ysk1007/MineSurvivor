## About the tool
Most unity developers know that dealing with rule tiles is a long and tedious process. With this tool I want to make this process easier, while also providing extra features which is not possible with default rule tiles.

## Features
- Draw in all the tile placement possibilities into a single grid, no need to set rules by hand
- Edit multiple tiles on a one grid, and save them into a single asset for better file organization
- Includes more rules than the default rule tile, which enables different tiles to interact with eachother on the tilemap
